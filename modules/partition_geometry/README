Plugin 'Partition Geometry' converts a spatial database table into a
partitioned table

Example:
  -- create a test-table for demonstration
  create table test (
    id	text	not null,
    tags	hstore	
  );
  select AddGeometryColumn('test', 'way', 900913, 'GEOMETRY', 2);

  -- convert table into a partitioned table
  select partition_geometry_init_table('test', '/path/to/boundary_file.900913', 'geom_column=>way, srid=>900913');
  
  -- insert something into the table:
  insert into test values ('foo', 'foo=>bar', ST_Point(5, 5));
  -- a message "INSERT 0 0" will be written to stdout ... this is a known 
  -- problem with partitioning. try it, you'll see, the content is there
  
  -- you can use the table as you were used too, but this would always include
  -- a search on all tables and there could be duplicates (so you should use
  -- disinct)
  select distinct * from test where way && ST_MakeEnvelope(-10, -10, 10, 10, 900913) and tags @> 'foo=>bar';
  select distinct * from test where id='foo';

  -- place a query on the table with "speedup" - this only queries the
  -- subtables which can hold the object(s):
  select * from test(ST_MakeEnvelope(-10, -10, 10, 10, 900913), $$tags @> 'foo=>bar'$$);
  -- use $$ instead of ', so you don't have to double quote inner '

The following tables and functions will be created:
  table 'test'               ... the original table
  table 'test_partition_geometry' ... a list of all partitions of test
  tables 'test_X'            ... where X are numbers -> the partitions
  function 'test(boundary, where, options)'
	 ... place a query on test. only a bounding box check will be done
	     (with &&), so be aware that this function might return objects
	     actually outside the boundary but with overlapping bounding boxes.
             where might be empty.
	     currently no options are supported.
  function 'test_get_table_list(geometry)'
         ... returns all partitions which intersect the geometry

The following general tables and functions are available:
  table 'partition_tables'
                             ... list of all tables which are partitioned
  function 'partition_geometry_init_table(table_name, path to boundary file, options)'
                             ... initialize partitioning for a table
  function 'partition_geometry_add_index(table_name, def)'
			     ... create an index on all tables. supply
				 defintion as it would fit for the original
				 table
